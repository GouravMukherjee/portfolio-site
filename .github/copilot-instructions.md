Execution Guidelines
- Track progress with the todo list when available and mark steps as they finish.
- Keep communication concise; only note skipped steps briefly.
- Use the current workspace root (.) for commands and avoid creating new folders unless requested.
- Use placeholders only when necessary and flag them for replacement.
- Install only extensions explicitly requested by setup info.
- Consider a task done when the project scaffolds and compiles, docs are current, and launch instructions are provided.
